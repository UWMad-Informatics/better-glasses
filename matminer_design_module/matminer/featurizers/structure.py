class BondFractions(BaseFeaturizer):

    Compute the fraction of each bond in a structure, based on NearestNeighbors.

    For example, in a structure with 2 Li-O bonds and 3 Li-P bonds:

    Li-0: 0.4
    Li-P: 0.6

    Features:

    BondFractions must be fit with iterable of structures before featurization in
    order to define the allowed bond types (features). To do this, pass a list
    of allowed_bonds. Otherwise, fit based on a list of structures. If
    allowed_bonds is defined and BondFractions is also fit, the intersection
    of the two lists of possible bonds is used.

    For dataframes containing structures of various compositions, a unified
    dataframe is returned which has the collection of all possible bond types
    gathered from all structures as columns. To approximate bonds based on
    chemical rules (ie, for a structure which you'd like to featurize but has
    bonds not in the allowed set), use approx_bonds = True.

    BondFractions is based on the "sum over bonds" in the Bag of Bonds approach,
    based on a method by Hansen et. al "Machine Learning Predictions of Molecular
    Properties: Accurate Many-Body Potentials and Nonlocality in Chemical Space"
    (2015).

        nn (NearestNeighbors): A Pymatgen nearest neighbors derived object. For
            example, pymatgen.analysis.local_env.VoronoiNN().
        bbv (float): The 'bad bond values', values substituted for
            structure-bond combinations which can not physically exist, but
            exist in the unified dataframe. For example, if a dataframe contains
            structures of BaLiP and BaTiO3, determines the value to place in
            the Li-P column for the BaTiO3 row; by default, is 0.
        no_oxi (bool): If True, the featurizer will be agnostic to oxidation
            states, which prevents oxidation states from  differentiating
            bonds. For example, if True, Ca - O is identical to Ca2+ - O2-,
            Ca3+ - O-, etc., and all of them will be included in Ca - O column.
        approx_bonds (bool): If True, approximates the fractions of bonds not
            in allowed_bonds (forbidden bonds) with similar allowed bonds.
            Chemical rules are used to determine which bonds are most 'similar';
            particularly, the Euclidean distance between the 2-tuples of the
            bonds in Mendeleev no. space is minimized for the approximate
            bond chosen.
        token (str): The string used to separate species in a bond, including
            spaces. The token must contain at least one space and cannot have
            alphabetic characters in it, and should be padded by spaces. For
            example, for the bond Cs+ - Cl-, the token is ' - '. This determines
            how bonds are represented in the dataframe.
        allowed_bonds ([str]): A listlike object containing bond types as
            strings. For example, Cs - Cl, or Li+ - O2-. Ions and elements
            will still have distinct bonds if (1) the bonds list originally

class BagofBonds(BaseFeaturizer):
    """
    Compute a Bag of Bonds vector, as first described by Hansen et al. (2015).

    The Bag of Bonds approach is based creating an even-length vector from a
    Coulomb matrix output. Practically, it represents the Coloumbic interactions
    between each possible set of sites in a structure as a vector.

    BagofBonds must be fit to an iterable of structures using the "fit" method
    before featurization can occur. This is because the bags and the maximum
    lengths of each bag must be set prior to featurization. We recommend
    fitting and featurizing on the same data to maintain consistency
    between generated feature sets. This can be done using the fit_transform
    method (for lists of structures) or the fit_featurize_dataframe method
    (for dataframes).

    BagofBonds is based on a method by Hansen et. al "Machine Learning
    Predictions of Molecular Properties: Accurate Many-Body Potentials and
    Nonlocality in Chemical Space" (2015).

        token (str): The string used to separate species in a bond, including
            spaces. The token must contain at least one space and cannot have
            alphabetic characters in it, and should be padded by spaces. For
            example, for the bond Cs+ - Cl-, the token is ' - '. This determines
            how bonds are represented in the dataframe.

class StructuralHeterogeneity(BaseFeaturizer):
    """
    Variance in the bond lengths and atomic volumes in a structure

    These features are based on several statistics derived from the Voronoi
    tessellation of a structure. The first set of features relate to the
    variance in the average bond length across all atoms in the structure.
    The second relate to the variance of bond lengths between each neighbor
    of each atom. The final feature is the variance in Voronoi cell sizes
    across the structure.

    We define the 'average bond length' of a site as the weighted average of
    the bond lengths for all neighbors. By default, the weight is the
    area of the face between the sites.

    The 'neighbor distance variation' is defined as the weighted mean absolute
    deviation in both length for all neighbors of a particular site. As before,
    the weight is according to face area by default. For this statistic, we
    divide the mean absolute deviation by the mean neighbor distance for that
    site.

    Features:
        mean absolute deviation in relative bond length - Mean absolute deviation
            in the average bond lengths for all sites, divided by the
            mean average bond length
        max relative bond length - Maximum average bond length, divided by the
            mean average bond length
        min relative bond length - Minimum average bond length, divided by the
            mean average bond length
        [stat] neighbor distance variation - Statistic (e.g., mean) of the
            neighbor distance variation
        mean absolute deviation in relative cell size - Mean absolute deviation
            in the Voronoi cell volume across all sites in the structure.
            Divided by the mean Voronoi cell volume.

    How much the ordering of species in the structure differs from random

    These parameters describe how much the ordering of all species in a

    parameter. The first step of this calculation is to determine the nearest
    neighbor shells of each site. Then, for each shell a degree of order for
    each type is determined by computing:

    :math:`\alpha (t,s) = 1 - \frac{\sum_n w_n \delta (t - t_n)}{x_t \sum_n w_n}`

    where :math:`w_n` is the weight associated with a certain neighbor,
    :math:`t_p` is the type of the neighbor, and :math:`x_t` is the fraction
    of type t in the structure. For atoms that are randomly dispersed in a
    structure, this formula yields 0 for all types. For structures where
    each site is surrounded only by atoms of another type, this formula
    yields large values of :math:`alpha`.

    The mean absolute value of this parameter across all sites is used
